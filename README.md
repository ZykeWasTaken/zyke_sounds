# Very Big Words So Important Disclaimer

The following information below is not to discourage anyone downloading if they have been instructed to do so. It works as intended and will not cause issues. The information below is general knowledge for anyone downloading without needing it as a dependency for one of your installed resources.

This is a work-in-progress resource that I created to bring zyke_smoking to life. When adding sounds to my resource I noticed several issues such as volume based on distance to the audio source, 0.5-1s delays and whatnot in popular alternatives. This resource solves that, allowing me to develop more immersive resources.

This is not something I recommend downloading and utilizing in your own projects without knowing what you are doing. It is very barebones and was only developed as far as I needed it to be.

In the future I might develop this further and make a proper release.
