# Very Big Words So Important Disclaimer

This is a work-in-progress resource that I created to bring zyke_smoking to life. When adding sounds to my resource I noticed several issues such as volume based on distance to the audio source, 0.5-1s delays and whatnot in popular alternatives. This resource solves that, allowing me to develop more immersive resources.

This is not something I recommend downloading and utilizing in your own projects without knowing what you are doing. It is very barebones and was only developed as far as I needed it to be.

In the future I might develop this further and make a proper release.
